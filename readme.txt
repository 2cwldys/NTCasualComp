Casual Comp PUG Server for NEOTOKYOÂ°

Add your STEAMID[64] to admins.cfg in addons/sourcemod/configs.

This allows you to run an ordinary PUB server with rate fixing, quality of life plugins, ghost and weapon tweaks, while obscuring competitive plugins until enabled.

!admin > server settings > exec cfg > warmode ON to enable competitive play.

sm_newpassword (admin only) generates a server password
sm_emptypassword (admin only) empties server password to "" on demand

RTVing or changing the MAP will result in the server password being restored to "" nothing.

KNOWN ISSUES:
If you disable warmode to restore original pub server state, player enemies remain unkillable due to comp godmode,
Do !rtv or !map to leave the current map to reset functionality.

ALL PLUGINS AND THEIR SOURCE CODE BELONG TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNERS.

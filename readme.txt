Casual Comp PUG Server for NEOTOKYOÂ°

Add your STEAMID[64] to admins.cfg in addons/sourcemod/configs.

This allows you to run an ordinary PUB server with rate fixing, quality of life plugins, ghost and weapon tweaks, while obscuring competitive plugins until enabled.

!admin > server settings > exec cfg > warmode ON to enable competitive play.

sm_newpassword (admin only) generates a new server password for you.
sm_emptypassword (admin only) empties server password to "" on demand.

RTVing or changing the MAP will result in the server password being restored to "" nothing.
Typing !pug as admin will trigger sm_nt_pugmode 0/1 values, which handle sm_warmode_on/off.cfg(s)
Typing !privatepug as admin will trigger sm_nt_privatepug 0/1 values, indicating if the server will be locked in PUG mode.

ALL PLUGINS AND THEIR SOURCE CODE BELONG TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNERS.
